## How to contribute to Inovativ Open Source projects?

### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/Inovativ/feedback/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/Inovativ/feedback/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title with a reference to the project and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue. Simply copy the content of the appropriate template into a .md file, make the necessary changes to demonstrate the issue, and **paste the content into the issue description**:
  * [**SMB Blueprint ARM** (AzureRM templates) issues](https://github.com/Inovativ/Feedback/)
  * [**SMB Blueprint PowerShell** (powershell module) issues](https://github.com/Inovativ/Feedback/)
  * [**SMB Blueprint Documentation** (documentation)](https://github.com/Inovativ/Feedback/)

### **You want to enhance a project?**

* Log an issue and provide a meaningful title and description ** on the project repo itself **
* Next, fork the repository and and create a pull request whenever you are ready.

Note that we only accept pull requests on a per feature basis. After forking, save your work in a dedicated feature branch.
